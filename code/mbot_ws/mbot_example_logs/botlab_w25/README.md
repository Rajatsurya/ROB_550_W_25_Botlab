The log files in the `botlab` folder contain GROUND_TRUTH_POSE data with an offset. 

This folder contains log files generated by running `python3 lcm_modify.py`. These files have been processed to remove the offset, making them ready for direct use.


The map files in this folder are copy-pasted from `botlab` folder, nothing changed.
